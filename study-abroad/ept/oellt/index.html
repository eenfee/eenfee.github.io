<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Hello Now, I will begin my presentation.

Today, I’ll be speaking about a topic that directly affects many children and families around the world — **providing government-funded school meals as a way to address food insecurity**.

Food insecurity, which means not having consistent access to enough food due to high prices or poverty, is a serious and growing issue in many countries. One proposed solution is for governments to provide free meals in schools, especially for children from low-income families. This idea has received both strong support and some criticism. In this presentation, I’ll explore both sides and share my personal view at the end.

🟢 First and foremost, **school meals improve children's health and nutrition**. When students receive regular, balanced meals at school, it helps with their physical development and prevents hunger during the school day.
Second, **it enhances academic performance**. Well-fed students are more focused and energized, leading to better concentration, higher attendance rates, and improved learning outcomes. For example, studies in Finland show that students who have access to school meals tend to perform better overall.
Third, **it reduces financial pressure on families**. Many parents struggle to provide three full meals a day. Offering meals at school means families can save money and use their limited income for other basic needs like housing or healthcare.

🔴 However, this plan also comes with challenges. The biggest concern is **the financial burden on the government**. Running a national school meal program is expensive and may require raising taxes or reducing budgets in other important sectors like healthcare or infrastructure. Another issue is the **risk of long-term dependence**. Some argue that continuous free services may discourage families from becoming financially self-reliant or from seeking other solutions to their struggles. Finally, **implementing and managing these programs is not easy**. If not properly handled, they can result in poor food quality, excessive food waste, or corruption in the system. In some countries, poorly managed meal programs have failed to meet nutritional standards and lost public trust.

💬 Despite these drawbacks, I **strongly support** the idea of government-funded school meals. I believe it is a meaningful investment in children’s well-being and their future. When students are healthy and focused, they learn better and grow into productive members of society. This is not just an education issue, but also a social and economic one. Moreover, for many families, this kind of support is a lifeline that helps them stay afloat during difficult times. And if programs are well designed, the risks can be managed.

🧭 To conclude, **providing free school meals** comes with financial and logistical challenges, but the benefits — better health, better learning, and stronger family support — make it a powerful solution to tackle food insecurity. I believe it is a step toward creating a more equal and supportive society.

Thank you very much for your attention.

<p><ins> <strong>💡 Pro Tips for Success</strong> </ins><br />
✔ <strong>Use rich vocabulary</strong> (e.g., <em>bustling, serene, chaotic</em>).<br />
✔ <strong>Structure logically</strong> (Don’t jump between foreground/background).<br />
✔ <strong>Keep talking</strong>—even if you pause, describe what comes to mind.</p>

<p><strong>❓ Common Examiner Follow-Up Questions</strong><br />
After describing the image, you may be asked:</p>
<ol>
  <li><em>“What do you think happened before/after this scene?”</em></li>
  <li><em>“How would you feel if you were in this image?”</em></li>
  <li><em>“Does this remind you of a place you’ve visited?”</em></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Sample Answer:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>“This reminds me of a beach trip I took last year. The energy was similar—everyone was relaxed and having fun under the sun.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
