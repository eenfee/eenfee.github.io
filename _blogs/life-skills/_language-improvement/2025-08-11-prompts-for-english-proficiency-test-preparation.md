## 📚 Using AI as Your Personal English Teacher

Artificial Intelligence is more than just a chatbot — it can be your **24/7 English tutor** for speaking, listening, writing, and reading. The secret is learning how to **write effective prompts** so the AI knows exactly what you want.

---

### 1️⃣ How to Write Effective Prompts

A great prompt tells the AI:
- **Role** → Who you want it to be  
- **Goal** → What you want to achieve  
- **Context** → Your current level and needs  
- **Task** → What activity you want  
- **Format** → How you want feedback  
- **Tone** → Encouraging, strict, or casual

💡 **Prompt formula**:  
`Role + Goal + Context + Task + Format + Tone`
