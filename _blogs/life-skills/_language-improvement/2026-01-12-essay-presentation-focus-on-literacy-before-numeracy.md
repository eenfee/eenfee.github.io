# Essay Presentation: Literacy before Numeracy

## Question: 
Some specialists argue that teaching young children to read and write should be prioritized over teaching mathematics in kindergarten. Discuss the benefits and drawbacks of focusing on literacy before numeracy, and give your own opinion on the issue.

## Presentation:

I will now begin my presentation.

Today, I would like to talk about whether teaching reading and writing is more important than teaching mathematics to children in kindergarten. This topic is widely debated among educators, as early childhood is a crucial stage for cognitive development. I will discuss both sides of the argument and then share my personal opinion.

On one hand, many experts believe that reading and writing should be taught before mathematics. One major advantage is that literacy forms the foundation for all future learning. Children who can read instructions and express their thoughts in writing are better able to understand other subjects, including math and science. Reading also helps improve vocabulary, communication skills, and imagination. Additionally, early exposure to language supports brain development and helps children perform better academically in later years. From this perspective, focusing on literacy first prepares children for formal education more effectively.

However, there are also disadvantages to prioritizing reading and writing over mathematics. Young children naturally develop numerical understanding through daily activities such as counting toys, sharing food, or recognizing patterns. If math is delayed, children may struggle with basic numeracy skills later on. Mathematics also develops logical thinking, problem-solving abilities, and reasoning skills from an early age. Ignoring math at the kindergarten level may create fear or anxiety toward the subject in the future. Therefore, completely prioritizing literacy over math can limit a child’s balanced development.

In my opinion, neither reading and writing nor mathematics should be treated as more important than the other. Instead, both should be taught together in an integrated and playful way. Kindergarten children learn best through activities, games, and real-life examples. For instance, storytelling can include counting, and writing activities can involve numbers. This balanced approach supports both language and numerical skills without overwhelming children.

To conclude, while reading and writing are essential for communication and learning, mathematics is equally important for developing logical thinking. A well-rounded kindergarten curriculum should focus on both literacy and numeracy to ensure healthy and holistic child development.


Thank you for your attention.
