## Why France Should Be on Your Radar

Imagine strolling through centuries-old cobblestone streets after a morning lecture at a renowned public university—this is life in France. Beyond the romance and architecture, France delivers:

* **Affordable Learning**: Public universities charge far less than their Western counterparts, keeping education accessible even for those on a budget.
* **International Classrooms**: Over 1,200 programs are taught entirely in English, especially at the master’s level—ideal if you’re not yet fluent in French.
* **Global Recognition**: A degree from France instantly opens doors worldwide, thanks to the country’s strong reputation for academic rigor.
* **Work While You Study**: Part-time jobs are permitted, so you can gain professional experience and offset living costs.
* **Post-Graduation Stay**: Master’s graduates can extend their visa up to 12 months to hunt for employment in fields such as engineering, IT, business analytics, hospitality, and fashion.
