# Flooding in Nepal: Himalayan Vulnerabilities, Monsoon Devastation, and Pathways to Resilience

Flooding is simply water going where it shouldn't. Overflowing, ponding/damming or simply irrigation gone wrong. In details, flooding is defined by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and UNESCO as (1) an overflowing by water of the normal confines of a watercourse or other body of water; (2) an accumulation of drainage water over areas not normally submerged; or (3) a controlled spreading of water for irrigation (WMO & UNESCO, 2012).

Nepal,have thoudands of rivers with over 6,000 rivers fed by monsoon rains and glacial melt, faces severe risks from fluvial, flash, and glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs), worsened by climate change, deforestation, urbanization, and poor land-use planning. Monsoon hits hard June-September. Water level dramatically increases in Koshi, Karnali, Narayani and other riversystems. Urban area such as Katmandu suffers because of poor planning, poor drainage and lack of green spaces.



### Key Flood Types in Nepal
- **Fluvial (riverine)**: Koshi, Narayani, Karnali rivers overflow in Terai during June–September monsoon.
- **Flash floods**: Rapid onset in hills after intense rainfall.
- **GLOFs**: Sudden release from unstable glacial lakes in Himalayas.
- **Ponding/surface water**: Urban drainage failures in Kathmandu Valley.

### Drivers and Recent Events
Heavy monsoon rain, cloudbursts, soil saturation, steep terrain, deforestation, river encroachment, and sand mining amplify risks. Climate change intensifies extremes.

Major recent events:
- September 2024 Kathmandu floods: Dozens killed, widespread damage from extreme rain and poor planning.
- 2024 Thame Valley GLOF: Destroyed infrastructure in Everest region.
- Monsoon 2024–2025: Hundreds affected, significant agricultural and infrastructure losses.

Historical toll (2000–2025): Over 4 million people impacted, thousands dead, billions in economic losses.

### Impacts
- **Human**: Drowning, trauma, displacement; waterborne diseases (cholera, typhoid), respiratory issues, mental health effects.
- **Economic**: Crop loss, damaged roads/bridges/hydropower, transport disruption.
- **Health**: Immediate deaths/injuries; long-term contamination and disease risks.


Why this mess - Heavy rain + bad planning = deaths + chaos.


Chaos of flood is worsinig now because of climate change, deforestation around rivers, sand mining, people building on flood plains.

### Monitoring and Risk Management
Department of Hydrology and Meteorology (DHM) uses rain gauges, river sensors, radar, satellites, and models. [BIPAD portal](https://bipadportal.gov.np/) and community EWS provide alerts.

Risk reduction follows [Sendai Framework and Integrated Flood Management (IFM)](https://www.preventionweb.net/files/43291_sendaiframeworkfordrren.pdf?startDownload=true): nature-based solutions (afforestation, wetlands), lake lowering, resilient codes, avoid floodplain building, early warning drills.



Challenges remain: transboundary rivers, enforcement gaps, urban sprawl, multi-hazard risks (floods + landslides).

### Conclusion
Floods are Nepal's top hazard, responsible for significant loss and damages, but enhanced EWS, GLOF projects, and integrated strategies offer pathways to resilience. Prioritize community-focused, nature-based measures and regional cooperation.
